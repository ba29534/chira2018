for GitHub users: 
Please let's continue to use the origin/master branch for draft 'releases' (the versions for everyone) only. 
If you want to type in your comments privately first before share them with the others and me, I'd like to ask you to work on a separate branch and (3-way-)merge it with the master branch when you're done.
Thank you :).
