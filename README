*** Sect. 1:

MM: I don't really understand these cites to Tan & Miyamoto. Usually I contrast large scale support with small-scale compressive promotion of collapse.
RC: I'm not sure whether I got the point of yours. I guess you mean: Gravitational contraction is supposed to be a small-scale effect that mainly  works on the structures within the MCs while the MCs themselves stay rather unaffected. This shall be in contrast to large-scale flows that injects energy into the system at scales of the entire; whereby the energy cascades down the scales and supports the small-scales where gravity is acting. Right?
If so, I always understood that the literature sketch the scene the other way around: gravity acts globally and on all scales while turbulence acts either locally (mostly stabilising) or globally (mostly destructive or catalysingly); and that's what I tried to express in the prior sentences.
