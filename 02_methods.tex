\subsection{Cloud models}\label{methods:clouds}

\rc{[general comment: In this sub-section I basically copied the descriptions we have used in the previous paper. I am not sure whether the summary given here in to short as I also wanted to provide a summary of the work we have done with the data already. I would appreciate what you think about the structure of this subsection.]}

The analysis in this paper is based on a sample of three molecular clouds (MCs) found within the 3D magnetohydrodynamics~(MHD), adaptive mesh refinement~(AMR) FLASH code \citep{Fryxell2000} simulations by \citet{IbanezMejia2016}.
\citet[hereafter \citetalias{IbanezMejia2016} and \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017}, respectively]{IbanezMejia2016,IbanezMejia2017} and \citet[hereafter \citetalias{Chira2017}]{Chira2017} describe the simulations and the clouds in more details. 
For the context of this paper, we here summarise the most relevant properties. 

The entire 3D MHD AMR simulations model a multi-phase, turbulent interstellar medium (ISM) of a disk galaxy where dense structures form self-consistently in turbulent, convergent flows \citepalias{IbanezMejia2016}. 
The simulations include gravity (stellar potential and dark matter halo, as well as self-gravity after 250~Myr simulated time), supernova-driven turbulence, photoelectric heating and radiative cooling, and magnetic fields. 
The three MCs of our sample are (40~pc)$^{3}$ subregions of the entire $1~\times~1~\times~40$~kpc$^3$ volume.
The authors of \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017} have re-simulated the clouds with an effective spatial resolution of $\Delta x_{\rm min}=0.1$~pc when mapped onto a $400\times 400~\times 400$ grid cells containing cube, respectively.
Substructures of the MCs are fully resolved if their local Jeans length $\lambda_J > 4~\Delta x_{\rm min}$, corresponding to a maximum resolved density of $8~\times 10^3$~cm$^{-3}$ at 10~K \citepalias[e.g.][Eq.~15]{IbanezMejia2017}.
This means that we can trace fragmentation down to 0.4~pc, but cannot fully resolve objects that form at smaller scales.
The MCs have total masses on the order of $3~\times 10^3$, $4~\times 10^3$, and $8~\times 10^3$~M$_{\odot}$ and are denoted as \texttt{M3}, \texttt{M4}, and \texttt{M8}, respectively, hereafter.

This set-up opens opportunities for many different kind of studies. 
The authors of \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017} have described the time evolution of the properties of all three clouds in detail.
In particular focus, the authors have investigated typical observables, such as mass, velocity dispersion, infall velocity and Mach number, in context of MC formation within spiral galaxies.
\citetalias{Chira2017} have studied the properties and time evolution, as well as the fragmentation behaviour of filaments that self-consistently condense within the model clouds. 
The authors have compared their measurements with typical stability criteria in order to evaluate whether they can also be used for predicting fragmentation.

In this paper, we focus on the driving sources of turbulence within the simulated MCs and the signatures they print on observables, such as the velocity structure function.


\subsection{Velocity Structure Functions}\label{methods:vsf}

We probe the power distribution of turbulence throughout the entire simulated MCs by using the so-called velocity structure function (VSF).
The VSF is a two-point correlation function that measures the mean velocity difference, $\Delta \vec{v} = \vec{v}(\vec{x}+\vec{\ell}) - \vec{v}(\vec{x})$, between two grid cells $\vec{x}$ and $\vec{x}+\vec{\ell}$ (with $\vec{\ell}$ being the direction vector pointing from the first to the second cell), to the $p^\mathrm{th}$ power as function of lag distance, $\ell = |\vec{\ell}|$, between the correlated points.
Thereby, the VSF estimates the occurrence of symmetric motions (e.g., rotation, collapse, outflows), as well as rare events of random turbulent flows (e.g., SNe) in velocity patterns.
Those patterns become more prominent the higher order $p$ is \citep{Heyer2004}.

For data on an Eulerian grid, such as ours, the density-weighted definition of the VSF, $\mathit{S}_p$, is given by
\begin{equation}
	\mathit{S}_p (\ell) = \frac{\langle \, \rho(\vec{x}) \rho(\vec{x}+\vec{\ell}) \, |\Delta \vec{v}|^p  \, \rangle}{\langle  \, \rho(\vec{x}) \rho(\vec{x}+\vec{\ell}) \, \rangle} ,
    \label{equ:method:def_vsf}
\end{equation}
\citep[and references within]{Padoan2016a}.
With this definition one can see that each order of the VSF has a physical meaning. 
For example, $\mathit{S}_1$ is to the mean relative velocities between cells, reflecting the modes created by different gas flows.
$\mathit{S}_2$ is proportional to the kinetic energy, making it a good probe of how the turbulent energy is transported to different scales.

If the turbulence is fully developed the VSF is supposed to be well-described by a power-law relation \citep{Kolmogorov1941,She1994,Boldyrev2002}:
\begin{equation}
	\mathit{S}_p (\ell) \propto \ell^{\zeta(p)} .
    \label{equ:method:propto_zeta}
\end{equation}
Note that the scaling exponent of that power-law relation, $\zeta$, depends on many parameters, such as the order of the VSF, as well as the properties and composition of the studied turbulent flow, like its geometry, compressibility or Mach number.
Many studies on VSFs distinguish between longitudinal and transverse velocity components, or compressible and solenoidal gas flow components because those are expected to behave differently, especially towards larger lag distances \citep{Gotoh2002,Schmidt2008,Benzi2010}.
However, the differences are mostly negligible on the scales we focus on. 
This and the fact that those components are observationally very hard to differentiate are the reasons why we analyse all components in a common sample.

There are some theoretical studies that predict values of $\zeta$ depending on the nature of turbulence and the order $p$.
For example, \citet{Kolmogorov1941} predicts that the third-order exponent, $\zeta(3)$, is equal unity for an incompressible, transonic flow.
This results in the commonly known prediction that the kinetic energy decays with $E_k(k) \propto k^{-\frac{5}{3}}$, with $k = \frac{2 \pi}{\ell}$ being the wavenumber of the turbulence mode.

For a supersonic flow, however, it is always supposed to be greater or equal to unity.
Based on \citeauthor{Kolmogorov1941}'s work, \citet{She1994} and \citet{Boldyrev2002} have extended and generalised the analysis and predict the following.
For an incompressible filamentary flow \citet{She1994} predict that the VSFs scale with,
\begin{equation}
	\zeta_\mathrm{She}(p) = \frac{p}{9} + 2 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{2}{3} \right)^{\frac{p}{3}} \right] = Z_\mathrm{She}(p) ,
    \label{equ:method:she}
\end{equation}
while supersonic flows with sheet-like geometry are supposed to scale with \citep{Boldyrev2002},
\begin{equation}
	 \zeta_\mathrm{Boldyrev}(p) = \frac{p}{9} + 1 - \left( \frac{1}{3} \right)^{\frac{p}{3}} = Z_\mathrm{Boldyrev}(p) .
    \label{equ:method:boldyrev}
\end{equation}
\citet{Benzi1993} have introduced the principle of "extended self-similarity" which propose that there is a fixed relation between the a VSF of $p^\mathrm{th}$ order and the 3$^\mathrm{rd}$ VSF, so that the ratio 
\begin{equation}
	Z(p) = \frac{\zeta(p)}{\zeta(3)}
	\label{equ:method:z_def}
\end{equation} 
is constant over all lag scales.
Since the mentioned predictions of $\zeta(p)$ are normalised in a way that $\zeta(3)$~=~1 Eq.~(\ref{equ:method:she}) and~(\ref{equ:method:boldyrev}) also provide the predictions for $Z(p)$, respectively.

For the discussion below, we measure $\zeta$ by fitting a power-law, given by
\begin{equation}
	\log_{10}\left[ S_p(\ell) \right] = \log_{10}\left(A\right) + \zeta \log_{10}(\ell) ,
    \label{equ:method:fitting}
\end{equation}
with $A$ being the scaling factor of the power-law to the simulated measurements.
For the calculations, we only take those cells with a minimal number density of 100~cm$^{-3}$ into account as this threshold defines the volume of the clouds.
For reducing the computational effort we divide the scale of 3D lag distances, $\ell$, into 40 equidistantly separated bins ranging from~0.1 to 30~pc.
This means that the measurements at the given lag interval $\ell_i$ we will show below base on the data with lag distances $\ell_{i-1} < \ell \leq \ell_i$.
