\section{Inertial Range}\label{appInertial}


{\bf For our analysis it is essential to verify that there is a
  reasonable range of scales $\ell$ below the driving range within
  which the simulations are not dominated by numerical effects,
%mm  but rather by correctly simulated as 
    so that 
they resolve the inertial range of any turbulent cascade.  
%mm
    We note that the fitting region for our VSFs starts at
    lags greater than 10 zones, ensuring that the numerical
    dissipation range lies at smaller scales.

%mm [restructured into subsections to break this up a bit.]
    To understand the non-power law behavior that we nontheless find,
    in the following subsections
we offer more examples that show VSFs of all three clouds at different
times and considering our different analysis approaches. 
%mm     In particular, we focus on the standard analysis
%(Sects.~\ref{results:normal} and~\ref{discussion:normal},
%Figs.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_with_threshold_s_vs_l}
%and~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_with_threshold_sl_vs_l}), the
%density threshold-less scenario (Sects.~\ref{results:densthres}
%and~\ref{discussion:densthres},
%Figs.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_without_threshold_s_vs_l}
%and~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_without_threshold_sl_vs_l}), and
%the impact analysis of different Jeans refinement levels
%(Sects.~\ref{results:refinement} and~\ref{discussion:refinement},
%Figs.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_jeans_s_vs_l}
%and~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_jeans_sl_vs_l}).
We focus on the standard analysis in Sect.~\ref{Bsub:standard}, on the
analysis neglecting the density threshold in Sect.~\ref{Bsub:full},
and on the impact of varying the resolution in collapsing regions in Sect.~\ref{Bsub:Jeans}.

\subsection{Standard Analysis}
\label{Bsub:standard}
\textbf{Figs.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_with_threshold_s_vs_l}
and~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_with_threshold_sl_vs_l} extend the
data presented in
Sect.~\ref{results:normal} and discussed in Sect.~\ref{discussion:normal}.
These figures use the same format as Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example}, but with data from all three clouds and at three different snapshots during the simulations.
    The straight lines within the plots indicate the power-law
    relation that we have fitted onto the VSFs, considering the range 
%mm 
\mm {[give $\ell$ min here]}
$\ell\,\leq$~8~pc.
}

\textbf{
    We see that in most of the cases the VSFs are in good agreement with the described power-law relation within the fitted ranges (e.g., Fig.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_with_threshold_s_vs_l}). 
    However, there are cases when the VSF is not well reproduced by a
    simple, single power-law function, such as 
%mm    Examples are: 
\texttt{M3} at $t=3.0$~Myr in
Fig.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_with_threshold_s_vs_l}.
%mm or \texttt{M3} at $t=0.8$~Myr and with $\lambda_\mathrm{J}$~=~32$\Delta$x in Fig.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_jeans_s_vs_l}.
%mm    In the first case, the dominating source of turbulence within
%the cloud is switching of large-scale driving to
%contraction-driven. This means that 
    This appears to occur particularly when the dominant mechanism
    driving turbulence changes from large-scale driving to internal
    contraction. At this point
the 
%mm outer regions 
    larger scales 
of the clouds (larger $\ell$) are still dominated by external driving,
while the 
%mm inner regions
    smaller scales (smaller $\ell$) start to accelerate mostly due to
    gravitational fragmentation and infall motions.
    The consequence is that the actual VSF is a superposition of two processes that amplify the relative motions of the gas differently and on different scales.
    A single power-law 
%mm is incapable to reproduce
    cannot describe 
this scenario adequately. 
%mm    However, this occurs only in a few time steps of all the simulations.

\subsection{No Density Threshold} \label{Bsub:full}
\textbf{Figs.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_without_threshold_s_vs_l}
and~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_without_threshold_sl_vs_l} extend
the set of VSFs for the box without a density threshold presented in
Sect.~\ref{results:densthres} and discussed in Sect.~\ref{discussion:densthres}.}

\textbf{Here we also find problems describing the behaviour of
        small-scale motions with $\ell\,\lesssim$~2~pc.
%mm when examining the data without applying a density threshold (see Figs.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_without_threshold_s_vs_l} and~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_without_threshold_sl_vs_l}).
        In this case we primarily capture the turbulent motions within
        the low-density ISM. 
Contrary to the modelled MCs, the ISM is not organised in hierarchical structures,
%mm Consequently, there are less differences in relative velocity between two zones that are close to each other, as the ISM is relatively homogeneous. 
%Within the clouds there are large gradients of relative velocities as
%two gas zones behave completely differently to each other depending
%on whether the connection line is parallel or perpendicular to one of
%the filaments. Furthermore, 
    and 
the turbulence within the ISM is predominantly driven by SN explosions.
%mm This is why the gas motions here are more chaotic and irregular
%than within the clouds where the flows are regulated and united by
%the hierarchical structures and self-gravity.
      These produce structured correlations at the large scales of entire
      blast waves as well as the small scales across shock fronts.
	Yet, we see that we can fit the VSFs with a power law within
        the intermediate lag scale ranges
        (2~pc~$\lesssim\,\ell\,\lesssim$~8~pc), 
%mm Within this range the models can moderately well reproduce the
%inertial range of the turbulent cascade, making it a good basis for
%the analysis we have presented in the main part of this paper.
      suggesting this range of length scales is dominated by a
      turbulent cascade.

\subsection{Varying Refinement} \label{Bsub:Jeans}
\textbf{Figs.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_jeans_s_vs_l}
  and~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_jeans_sl_vs_l} extend the set of
  VSFs presented for clouds with varying amounts of refinement in
  gravitationally collapsing regions in Sect.~\ref{results:refinement}
  and discussed in Sect.~\ref{discussion:refinement}.
}

\textbf{A final example of VSFs not following a power law at intermediate scales is given
    by cloud \texttt{M3} at $t=0.8$~Myr and with
    $\lambda_\mathrm{J} = 32\Delta x$ in
    Fig.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_jeans_s_vs_l}.  This represents the VSF of a cloud that is interacting with a SN blast wave.
    In this case the maximal amplification is neither 
%mm on the far end 
    at the scale 
of the cloud, where the turbulence is driven by external sources, nor on small scales where gravitational contraction acts.
    Instead the local maximum is the intermediate scale. 
    Considering the morphology of the cloud and the cloud's environment this can only occur when the shock front of a SN is currently propagating through the cloud. 
    Thus, the VSF here is a superposition of three driving mechanisms:
    first, the external large-scale driving; second, self-gravity that
    leads to contractive motions; and finally the shock jump that injects kinetic energy as it moves through the cloud. 
    The effect of the shock, however, is only local and short-lived as
    the injected turbulence decays quickly (compare with \texttt{M3}
    at $t=1.2$~Myr and with $\lambda_\mathrm{J} = 32\Delta x$ in Fig.~\ref{pic:appInertial:examples_jeans_s_vs_l}).
