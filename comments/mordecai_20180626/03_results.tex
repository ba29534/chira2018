\section{Results}\label{results}

In this section, we present our results on how velocity structure functions (VSFs) reflect the distribution of turbulent power within molecular clouds.

\subsection{Examples}
%mm [moved from section 2]
Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example} shows three examples of VSFs, (a) cloud \texttt{M4} at $t$~=~1.2~Myr after self-gravity has been activated in the simulations, (b) \texttt{M3} at $t$~=~3.5~Myr, and (c) \texttt{M3} at $t$~=~4.0~Myr.
All plots show the
%mm
    density-weighted 
VSFs of orders $p$~=~1--3.
%mm that are computed based on the simulation data.
The solid lines show the fitted power-law relations as given in Eq.~(\ref{equ:method:fitting}).

    \label{pic:results:vsf_example}
\end{figure*}

The examples demonstrate that, in general, the measured VSFs cannot be described by a single power-law relation over the entire range of $\ell$.
Instead they are composed of roughly three different regimes: 
one at small scales at $\ell \lesssim$~3~pc, a second one within 3~pc~$\lesssim \ell \lesssim$~10--15~pc, and the last one at large scales with $\ell >$~15~pc.
%mm Therefore,   ***** this is a result, not a deduction, right? ****** 
    We find that
only the small and intermediate ranges may be represented by a common power-law relation.
On larger scales, one observes a local minimum before the VSFs either increase or stagnate.
The location of the minimum coincides with the equivalent radius of the cloud, the radius a cloud of given mass would have if it would be a sphere.
%mm *********************
\mm{\bf [this is a pretty big claim to make based on one example. Can you make a plot showing the minimum location vs the equivalent radius for all three clouds for several times?  Otherwise, I'd consider cutting it.]}
Thus, in this context the VSF is an accurate tool to measure the size of a molecular cloud.
On smaller scales, which correspond to individual clumps and cores, one sees significant differences.

The examples in Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example} illustrate how 
%mm the clouds and their 
VSFs react to different scenarios that affect the turbulent structure of the entire clouds. 
\textbf{Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example}(a) shows the case where turbulence is driven on large scales and naturally decays towards smaller scales.
This is the most common behavior seen in all three MCs within the first $\sim$1.5~Myr of the simulations.}
During this interval of time the clouds experience the effect of self-gravity for the first time in their evolution and need to adjust to this new condition.
Until this is the case, their VSFs are dominated by the freely cascading turbulence that previously dominated the kinetic structure of the clouds.
Furthermore, this implies that we can only reliably examine turbulence within the simulations after 1.5~Myr and carefully need to take this into account in the further discussion \citep[see][]{IbanezMejia2017,Seifried2017b}.

The other examples represent the clouds at later stages of their evolution when the VSFs are dominated by sources that drive the 
%mm turbulence 
   flow
within the clouds in a more extreme way.
Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example}(b) shows the VSF of \texttt{M3} at a time when the cloud has just been hit by a SN shock front. 
One clearly sees how the amplitude of the VSFs is increased by one to two orders of magnitudes compared to the previous example.
Especially the power 
%mm of small scale turbulence
    at small scales ($\ell \lesssim$ few parsecs) is highly amplified \textbf{as a result of the shock, while it also reduces} the equivalent radius of the cloud.
%mm
     \mm{\bf [is that first minimum the thickness of the post-shock region, or the equivalent radius of the cloud?  I'd bet that it's the former.]}
Despite the increase of turbulent power at small scales, a large amount of energy is injected at large scales, as well.
All this results in a 
%mm steeper scaling of the VSF.   ***** 
\mm{\bf [looks shallower to me??]} 
     shallower slope of the VSF.
However, the effect of SN shocks last for only a short period of time (see below).

The last example, Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example}(c), demonstrates the imprint of gravitational contraction.
Here, the VSF is almost flat, or even slightly increasing towards smaller separation scales. 
This kind of profile is typical for gas that is self-gravitationally contracting \citep{Boneberg2015,Burkhart2015} since gas moves into the inner regions of the cloud, reducing the average lag distances, but not necessarily the relative velocities.
The latter may even be accelerated by the infall.
As a consequence, large amounts of kinetic energy are transferred to smaller scales which flattens the corresponding VSF.

\subsection{Time Evolution}

Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(a) plots the time evolution of the power-law index $\zeta(p)$ fit to the VSF obtained for each cloud, and each order $p$                    .
The figure shows several interesting features.
First, initially, at $t$~=~0~Myr, all calculated values of $\zeta$ are above the predicted values (see Eqs.~(\ref{equ:method:she}) and~(\ref{equ:method:boldyrev})).
%mm
     \mm{\bf [can you indicate this on the figure?]}
%mm This means that the turbulence within the clouds is highly supersonic before the gas begins to react to the activation of self-gravity. [I don't follow this conclusion.  Eq.~(\ref{equ:method:boldyrev}) is exactly the prediction for supersonic flow. This suggests that this is non-uniform flow.]   *************************
     This suggests that we are seeing excess power at large scales from the initial   
     convergent flows that formed the clouds.
Second, $\zeta$ for all orders decreases with time as the clouds gravitationally collapse.
%mm \textbf{This gravitational collapse causes gas around the collapsing centers to accelerate, increasing the relative velocities at small scales. This process leads to the flattening of the exponent of the structure function, $\zeta$, as a function of time. }
     Distributed gravitational collapse causes an increase in relative velocities at increasingly 
     small scales as material falls into filaments and nodes.  The increase in small-scale 
     power leads to a flattening of the VSF and thus a decrease in $\zeta$.
Third, occasionally one observes bumps and dips in all orders of VSFs (e.g., \texttt{M3} or \texttt{M8} around $t$~=~1.7~Myr). 
These features only last for short periods of time (up to 0.6~Myr), but set in 
%mm quasi-instantly and represent a complete relocation of the turbulent power particularly
   rather abruptly and represent sudden changes in large-scale power that 
   change the VSF slope.

%mm [This paragraph seems out of place, as it refers to M8, without a preceding discussion of M3 and M5.] ****************************

\texttt{M8} seems to develop differently.
At the time the SN occurring at $t$~=~0.8~Myr hits the cloud the values of $\zeta$ do not rise, as they have done within the other two clouds, but instead they drop. 
After the shock all scaling exponents grow to levels that are slightly above the pre-shock values, before they slowly decrease again.

$Z$ (for example, in \texttt{M4} at $t$~=~4.1~Myr) occur at times when the scaling exponents of the VSFs $\zeta(3)$ reach values close to or below 0.

In the rest of this section, we study how VSFs 
%mm react to variety of setups that are typically assumed in comparable studies.
    computed in different ways compare to these density weighted results.
We compare the findings with the results we have obtained with our original setup.
In Sect.~\ref{discussion}, we will discuss and interpret these results in more detail.


\subsection{Line-of-Sight VSF}\label{results:1d}

Previously, we have seen how the VSF behaves and evolves within the clouds.
By doing so, we derived the relative velocities based on the 3D velocity vectors 
%mm that we read out 
from the simulations.
%mm Yet, this method is rather not applicable for many other studies.  It is either computational expensive or not possible as observations generally only provide the velocity component along the line-of-sight.
    However, observed VSFs can only be measured using line-of-sight velocities.
Thus, in this subsection we investigate how VSFs derived from 1D relative velocities compare to the 3D VSFs presented before.
%mm Thereby, we define the 1D VSF as follows:
% \begin{equation}
% 	\mathit{S}_p^\mathrm{1D} (\ell) = \frac{\langle \, \rho(\vec{x}) \rho(\vec{x}+\vec{\ell}) \, |\Delta \vec{v} \cdot \vec{e}_i|^p  \, \rangle}{\langle  \, \rho(\vec{x}) \rho(\vec{x}+\vec{\ell}) \, \rangle} ,
%     \label{equ:results:def_vsf_1d}
% \end{equation}
% with $\vec{e}_i$ representing the unit vector along the $i$~=~x-, y-, or z-axis.
Figures~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(b) and~\ref{pic:results:z_all}(b) show measured $\zeta$ and $Z$, respectively, derived based on Eq.~(\ref{equ:results:def_vsf_1d}). 
We see that, in most of the cases, all 1D VSFs agree well with each other, as well as with the corresponding 3D VSFs.
Yet, there are cases in which the 1D VSF evolves temporarily or completely differently than the 3D VSF.
For example, the 1D VSF along the x-axis in \texttt{M3} initially behaves like the corresponding 3D VSF, though with lower absolute values of $\zeta$ (or higher values of $Z$).
However, during the period $t$~=~2.5--3.8~Myr the functions diverge. 
While the 3D $\zeta$ 
%mm ceases
    decreases 
further and switches sign, the $\zeta$ based on the 1D VSF along the $x$-axis shows a local maximum before converging with the 3D $\zeta$ again. 


\subsection{Density Thresholds}\label{results:densthres}

%mm [moved to Section 2
% Another assumption that significantly influences the structure and evolution of VSFs is the (number) density threshold, $n_\mathrm{cloud}$, that is normally applied to filter out the cells that are part of the clouds.
% In this paper, we assume a minimal number density of $n_\mathrm{cloud}~=$~100~cm$^{-3}$.
% This means that, when focusing on the cloud-only gas, we only consider those cells with number densities $n \geq n_\mathrm{cloud}$.
% We have chosen this threshold as it roughly corresponds to the density when CO becomes detectable.

% %mm However, 
% \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017} shows that there is usually no sharp increase in density between the ISM and the clouds. 
% Instead, the gas becomes continuously denser towards the centres of mass within the clouds. 
% Consequently, 
% %mmintroducing
%     our use of 
% a density threshold is a 
% %mm rather artificial, physically weakly motivated distinction 
%      somewhat artificial boundary
% between the clouds and the ISM. Observationally, however, introducing a 
% %mm
%     column 
% density (or intensity) threshold is unavoidable, be it due to technical limitations (e.g., %mm sensibility of detector)
%      detector sensitivity) 
% or the nature of the underlying physical processes (for example, excitation rates, or critical densities).
% Therefore, it is important to study 
% %mm to what extent 
%      how a density threshold influences the VSF and its evolution.

%mm[moved to Sect 2]
% \textbf{Furthermore, this approach considers only $\leq$1.5\% of the cubes' volumes.
% Removing the density threshold, by setting n$_\mathrm{cloud}$~=~0~cm$^{-3}$, would result in analysing the entire data cube.
% As this would be too computationally expensive,
% %mm  for the test scenario we present here, 
% we randomly choose a set of 5\% of the total number of cells as reference points and compute relative velocities to these cells only.
% We emphasise that this does not mean that we only calculate the relative velocities between these cells.
% Rather this subsample of cells represent the starting vectors $\vec{x}$ to which the velocities of all other cells $\vec{x} + \vec{\ell}$ in the same cube are compared to.
% This way we reduce the risk of ignoring or emphasising any spatial direction or angle.}

% \textbf{Note that by choosing the starting points randomly we ensure that all parts of the cubes are considered. 
% As a consequence, there is only a littlesmall likelihood (5\%~$\times$~1.5\%~=~0.075\%) that cells associated with the clouds are chosen.
% Therefore, we emphasise that it is likely that the two subsamples (no density threshold and cloud-only) do not necessarily have a common subset of starting vectors.
% Yet, as we here still calculate relative velocities to all other cells in the cube, and that includes all cells making up the clouds, the resulting VSFs of the n$_\mathrm{cloud}$~=~0~cm$^{-3}$ sample also consists of most of the information of the inner-cloud interactions.}

%mm In Figs.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}c and~\ref{pic:results:z_all}c we show the measured values of $\zeta$ and $Z$, respectively, that are derived from the data cubes without introducing an density threshold, meaning $n_\mathrm{cloud}~=$~0~cm$^{-3}$.
     We now examine the VSFs of the entire data cubes without setting a density 
     threshold ($n_\mathrm{cloud}~=$~0~cm$^{-3}$).  Figure~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(c) shows 
     $\zeta$, while Figure~\ref{pic:results:z_all}(c) shows $Z$ in this case.
% This means that we now do not only calculate the relative velocities between cells that are part of the clouds' volume, but between cells within the entire 400$^3$ cell cut-outs that contain both the clouds and the ISM.
% For our calculations we apply the same methods as described in Sect.~\ref{methods}. 
% Yet, in order to reduce the computational effort we choose only a randomly positioned subset of 3,200,000 cells (=~5\% of the entire 400$^3$ cube) within the entire cubes as reference points, $\vec{x}$. 
% As the clouds make up only a small fraction of the volume within the cubes ($\approx$1.5\%), this approach makes it more like to pick locations within the modelled ISM, rather than cells within the clouds. 
% We emphasise that, by doing so, we only influence the choice of $\vec{x}$ in Eq.~(\ref{equ:method:def_vsf}), not $\vec{x+\ell}$ as we still compute the relative velocities relative to every other cell at 3D lag distance $\ell$ within the entire cube. 
%
%Figs.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}c and~\ref{pic:results:z_all}c 
    These Figures
clearly illustrate that the measurements in the samples without density threshold completely differ from those with the density threshold.
Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(c) shows that the measured values of $\zeta$ are much higher in the ISM than in the cloud-only sample.
Although we see a similar decline of $\zeta$ in \texttt{M4} and \texttt{M8} as the gas contracts under the influence of gravity in the vicinity of the clouds, $\zeta$ generally evolves differently here than %mm what we have observed for the cloud-only matter. E.g., the pronounced features that have reflected the interactions between the clouds' gas and shock waves are either not as significantly visible or not present at all.
    in the analysis focused on the clouds.
We see a high rate of random fluctuations in the evolution of $\zeta$, as well.
Furthermore, contrary to all of our other test scenarios, we see here that all $Z$ are constant in time and within all clouds, with values slightly lower than those predicted by \citet{She1994} for 
%mm filamentary
    incompressible
flows.  
%mm
     This is consistent with the high sound speed in the hot gas that fills most of the volume of  
     the computational box, which results in subsonic flows predominating.


\subsection{Density Weighting}\label{results:densweight}

As mentioned in Sect.~\ref{methods:vsf}, Eq.~(\ref{equ:method:def_vsf}) represents the definition of the density-weighted VSF.
%mm [I don't understand this point.  The VSF is a two-point measurement without historical information, so it doesn't matter how we sample the background field, as far as I can see.] The density weighting is required for this study to account for obtaining the data from smooth density distributions on Eulerian grids, instead of using individual Lagrangian test particles (or eddies) as it is actually supposed to.
%Thus, the question is: How the two approaches compare with each other?
    While this represents the observational situation better, the theoretical predictions 
    were developed for the unweighted statistic.  Thus a comparison of results for the 
    two variations in our model is of interest. 
There are a few studies that have targeted this question 
\citep[e.g.,][]{Benzi1993,Schmidt2008, Benzi2010,Gotoh2002}.  
However, all of them considered 
%mmturbulent flows in sterile, homogeneous environments
    isotropic, homeogeneous, turbulent flows
that are not comparable to our clouds.
%mm Other studies, like 
\citet{Padoan2016a} use both methods, but not on the same set of data. 

In this section, we investigate the influence of density weighting on VSFs by repeating the original analysis with the non-weighted VSF given by
%mm \begin{equation}
%	\mathit{S}_p (\ell) = \langle \, |\Delta \vec{v}|^p  \, \rangle = \langle \, |\vec{v}(\vec{x}) - \vec{v}(\vec{x} + \vec{\ell})|^p  \, \rangle .
%    \label{equ:results:def_vsf_no}
%\end{equation}
    Eq.~\ref{equ:method:def_vsf}
Figs.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(d) and~\ref{pic:results:z_all}(d) show the measured values of $\zeta$ and $Z$ derived from the non-weighted VSFs, respectively.

Comparing the weighted and non-weighted samples, we see the following:
The non-weighted $\zeta$ (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}d) 
%mm and $Z$ (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all}d) 
traces the interactions between the gas of the clouds and the SN shocks in the same way as occurs for the density-weighted VSF.
In \texttt{M3} and \texttt{M8} we also see that the values of $\zeta$ decrease as the clouds evolve, yet not as fast as they do in the density-weighted VSFs. 
The measurements in \texttt{M4}, however, are almost constant over time. 
In all the cases, the values of $\zeta$ never 
%mm cease 
     decrease
below 0.5; a behaviour that clearly differs from what we have observed in the density-weighted VSFs. 
\mm{[somewhere we need to explain that this means that taking out the density weighting decreases the effective small-scale power, explaining the higher values of zeta.  Maybe this is done below.]}

We observe a similar behaviour for measured values of $Z$
%mm
    (Fig ~\ref{pic:results:z_all}d). 
%mm As before, they are almost constant over time and in good agreement with predicted values. The only derivations we see compared to the previous results are caused by the interactions between the clouds and incoming SN shock fronts, with levels of disturbance that are similar to the measurements using density-weighted VSFs. 
    The density weighting weakens the influence of the highly compressible flows in the 
    densest regions, but not so much as in the case with no density threshold.  As a result 
    the values of $Z$ fluctuate slightly when shocks hit, and otherwise vary between 
    the compressible and incompressible limits.
However, the evolution of $Z$s is smoother as there is no sign inversion of $\zeta$.
This means that we do not have any strong peaks in $Z$ indicating the time when $\zeta(3)$ approaches 0, which happened when the majority of the turbulent power has transferred to the small scales. \mm{[this needs to be mentioned in the initial analysis.]}

\mm{[move to 4, after discussion of Jeans length refinement?]}
Fig.~\ref{pic:results:comp_weighting} summarises the comparison of $\zeta$ (\textit{top}) and $Z$ (\textit{bottom}) measured with the density-weighted (\textit{abscissas}) and non-weighted VSFs (\textit{ordinates}) for all Jeans refinement levels \textbf{(meaning the granularity used for modelling the turbulent motions of the gas, see Sect.~\ref{results:refinement} for more details)}.
The figure clearly shows that the measurements only agree well for the highest refinement level with $\lambda~=~32\Delta x$.
However, we would need more data point to be sure that this correlation is indeed real.
At lower refinement level the measurements\textbf{, as those used for the standard analysis and all other test scenarios but the one presented in Sect.~\ref{results:refinement},} correlate less well with each other. 
The differences in the samples appear dominantly when the density-weighted $\zeta$ cease below $\approx$0.5, which is the global minimum for the non-weighted $\zeta$. 
This means that none of the $\zeta$ computed in all clouds and refinement levels with the non-weighted VSF is measured to be below 0.5.

\end{figure*}




\subsection{Jeans Length Refinement}\label{results:refinement}

The results we have discussed so far are based on simulation data 
%mm as they have been 
presented in \citetalias{IbanezMejia2016} and \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017}.
Due to the huge computational expense of the variety of physical and numerical processes (fluid dynamics, adaptive mesh refinement, supernovae, magnetic fields, radiative heating and cooling, and many more) within those simulations, though, they have required some compromises.
%mm
One of these compromises was the Jeans refinement criterion used as part of the AMR mechanisms.
The authors resolved local Jeans lengths by only four cells ($\lambda_J=4\Delta{}x$).
This is the minimal requirement for modelling self-gravitating gas in 
%mm
    disks in
order to avoid artificial fragmentation \citep{Truelove1998}. 
Other studies, for example by \citet{Turk2012}, have shown that a significantly higher refinement is needed to reliably resolve turbulent structures and flows
%mm on scales of individual cells.
    within disks to resolve turbulence.  In our case, the key question is how quickly 
    the turbulent cascade fills in after the multiple steps of refinement to higher resolution 
    required to develop the high resolution cubes we use.  Although we have a 
    different physical situtation, the earlier results still emphasize the importance of 
    how well the Jeans length is resolved.

In the appendix of \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017}, the authors examine the effect the number of cells used for the Jeans refinement has on the measured kinetic energy.
For this, they have rerun the simulations of \texttt{M3} twice; 
once with 
%mm a refinement of eight cells per Jeans length (
$\lambda_J=8\Delta{}x$ for the first 3~Myr after self-gravity was activated, and once with %mm 32 cells per Jeans length (
$\lambda_J=32\Delta{}x$ for the first megayear of the cloud's evolution.
The authors show that the $\lambda_J=32\Delta{}x$ simulations smoothly 
%mm reveal
    recover 
the energy power spectrum on all scales already after this first megayear.
The other two setups do this, as well,
%mm .However, they need more time to overcome the resonances in the respective power spectra that originate from the previous resolution steps. 
     but only over longer timescales.
This is why one can only reliably trust the findings in this paper after the clouds have evolved for approximately 1.5~Myr \citep[see also][]{IbanezMejia2017,Seifried2017b}.

Furthermore, \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017} calculated the difference in the cloud's total kinetic energy as a function of time and refinement level.
They found that the $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ simulations miss a significant amount of kinetic energy, namely up to 13\% compared to $\lambda_J = 8\Delta{}x$ and 33\% compared to $\lambda_J = 32\Delta{}x$.
However, they also observed that these differences peak around $t=0.5$~Myr and decrease afterwards, as the $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ and $\lambda_J = 8\Delta{}x$ simulations adjust to the new refinement levels.
Thus, the results we have derived from the $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ simulations need to be evaluated with respect to this lack of turbulent energy, although the clouds' dynamics remains dominated by gravitational collapse.
It also means that the $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ data become more reliable the longer the simulations evolve.

In order to study  how the level of Jeans refinement influences the behaviour of the VSFs, we investigate the \texttt{M3} data of the $\lambda_J = 8\Delta{}x$ and $\lambda_J = 32\Delta{}x$ simulations.
%mm in the same way as we have done with the $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ data: measure the VSFs and analyse the time evolution of $\zeta$ and $Z$.
Figs.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}e and \ref{pic:results:z_all}e show $\zeta$ and $Z$ for  $\lambda_J = 8\Delta{}x$ and $\lambda_J = 32\Delta{}x$.
In Fig.~\ref{pic:results:jeans_comp} we directly compare the measurements of all refinement levels relative to $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$.

$\lambda_J = 8\Delta{}x$ shows the same behaviour as $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$, with values in both samples being in good agreement as the top panel of Fig.~\ref{pic:results:jeans_comp} demonstrates. 
Over the entire observed time span, the measured values of $\zeta$ decrease as the VSF become flatter.
At the time the SNe interact with the cloud,
%mm 
     over the course of about a megayear after traveling across the distance from the point of   
     explosion to the cloud, 
the VSFs steeply increase 
%mm forward 
      toward
larger scales 
%mm 
    \mm{\bf [but this seems to contradict Fig1 that shows shallower slopes after impact by SNe}], 
causing values of $\zeta$ (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}e)

Compared to the $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ sample, the peak in $\zeta$ is smoother and lasts longer

     These same effects can be seen in Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all}e where the drop of $Z$ due to the SN shock lasts longer than it 
%mm has done in within the
     did for
$\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$. 
Besides this, the time evolution of $Z$ for $\lambda_J = 8\Delta{}x$ is as sensitive to the turbulence-related events as it was for $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$.
The divergence produced when gravity has transferred the majority of power to smaller scales occurs at the same time. 
%mm Thereby, the 
    The actual
depth of the drop is a numerical artefact caused by $\zeta(3)$ being equal or close to zero at this very time step. 

The picture changes when we analyse the VSFs based on the $\lambda_J = 32\Delta{}x$ runs (Figs.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}e,~\ref{pic:results:z_all}e, and~\ref{pic:results:jeans_comp}).
Here one sees that the measured values of both $\zeta$ (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}e) and $Z$ (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all}e) are similar to those for $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ for the first 0.2~Myr.
After this short period, though, the evolution of $\zeta$ diverge. 
While $\zeta(1)$ and $\zeta(2)$ continue to decrease
%mm  in similar, but on lower rates compared to $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$, 
   similar to $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ but at lower rate, 
$\zeta(3)$ increases until it peaks at $t=0.8$~Myr and falls steeply again.
This divergence has notable impact on the evolution of $Z$, as well. 
The bottom panel of Fig.~\ref{pic:results:jeans_comp} illustrates the different evolutions of measured $\zeta$ and $Z$ in the two %mm samples of 
simulations more clearly.
One sees that the differences between the samples follow the same pattern for all orders of $p$.
The differences, though, increase with the order:
While the values for $\zeta(1)$ are still in good agreement, the measured values of $\zeta(2)$ and $\zeta(3)$ for $\lambda_J = 32\Delta{}x$ are 40\% and 100\% higher than those measured for $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$, respectively.
Consequently, this causes differences in $Z(p)$ of 30--52\% between the simulations.
At $t$~=~1.2~Myr, the last time step of this sample, the values of all $\zeta$ equal the measurements of $\lambda_J = 4\Delta{}x$ again.
As 
%mm there is no information of how the $\lambda_J = 32\Delta{}x$ simulations develop further we cannot predict whether this correspondence will continue. 
    the cost of extending the $\lambda_J = 32\Delta{}x$ simulation is prohibitive, we 
    cannot determine whether this agreement will continue.
