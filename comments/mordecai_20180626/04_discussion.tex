\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

%mm [This is new text trying to recast the existing discussion]
We have seen in Sect.~\ref{results} that density-weighted VSFs reflect a combination of uniform, compressible turbulence, large-scale shocks, and gravitational collapse.  Extended self-similarity emphasizes the turbulent nature of these high-Reynolds numbers flows even in regions of gravitational collapse. 

As the clouds gravitationally collapse, the resulting increase in small-scale power flattens or even inverts the density-weighted VSFs, resulting in decreasing or even negative values of $\zeta$ (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(a)). The increase in small-scale power can also be derived from the increasingly negative binding energy of the clouds as further gas falls into them \citepalias{IbanezMejia2017}.  Extended self-similarity shows VSF ratios characteristic of compressible turbulence (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all}a), as can be seen from their tending to lie between the incompressible limit of \citet{She1994} and the extremely compressible Burgers turbulence limit of \citet{Boldyrev2002}.  The extended self-similarity procedure fails as $\zeta(3)$ passes through zero, however, so it must be interpreted in concert with the raw values of $\zeta$.

The impact of SN shocks hitting the clouds is to inject power at all scales (Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example}).  The resulting VSFs tend to lose their power-law character. Fitting a power-law to them anyway results in substantial perturbations from the predictions for compressible turbulence even under extended self-similarity.  Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all} shows times of SN explosions and periods of strong accretion onto the clouds.  Note that the SN shock fronts move at speeds of 50--100~km~s$^{-1}$ through the ISM and the explosions occur at distances of 30--100~pc from the clouds, so the shocks need around 1~Myr to reach the clouds. Perturbations in $Z$ not associated with zero-crossings by $\zeta(3)$ are consistent with being caused by SN shock front interactions with the clouds.  These shock interactions last for only a fraction of a megayear, though, after which the turbulent nature of the flow reasserts itself.




%mm *********** I condensed the following discussion quite substantially above.  Please review to consider whether I lost any really important points. ************************ 

% In Sect.~\ref{results} we have seen that
% %mm [this is a little too coincidental] the shape of VSFs measured for the gas of simulated molecular clouds evolves in the same way as the clouds themselves.
%      as the clouds gravitationally collapse, the resulting increase in small-scale power 
%      flattens or even inverts the VSFs, resulting in decreasing or even negative values 
%      of $\zeta$
% %mm For example, Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(a) demonstrates that the measured $\zeta$ cease with time as the clouds contract under the influence of self-gravity.
%       (see Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}(a)  for an example).
% %mm This is evident as the density and boundness of the clouds increases
%       The increase in small-scale power can also be derived from the increasingly negative
%        binding energy of the clouds
%  \textbf{as} further gas falls into them \citepalias{IbanezMejia2017}.

% However, one also sees peaks in the profiles of $\zeta$ that represent a temporary deviation from the global evolution of the clouds.
% The origin of these features can 
% %mm easily 
% be traced back to SNe occurring in the environment of the clouds.
% To visualise this better, we showed in Fig.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all} the times when the SNe explode and the periods of time when the clouds are heavily accreting gas.
% The data are taken from \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017}, where mean distances between the sites of SNe and the centres of the clouds can also be found.
% Considering that the SN shock fronts move at speeds of 50--100~km~s$^{-1}$ through the ISM and the explosions occur at distances of 30--100~pc from the clouds, the shocks need around 1~Myr to reach the clouds.
% %mm Thus, one cannot only relate the major gas accretion events of the clouds to the arrival of those SNe, that indeed affect the evolution of the clouds, but also all significant variations in the evolution of $\zeta$.  [This seems too strong a statement, since we only have a consistency proof due to the frequent nearby SNe]
%     The variations in $\zeta$ are consistent with being caused by SN shock front 
%     interactions with the clouds.
% In most of the cases, the SNe inject turbulent power into the systems.
% This amplifies the VSFs at all scales, but in particular the large scales, causing an elevation of $\zeta$.
% However, the interaction between the clouds and the shocks lasts only for less than 0.6~Myr, after which $\zeta$ evolves back into the pre-shock conditions

% The behaviour of \texttt{M8} appears to contradict the \textbf{above explanations which we explain as follows}:
% In the beginning, \texttt{M8} evolves only slightly.
% It loses a small fraction of gas \citepalias[Fig.~5, \textit{middle} panel]{IbanezMejia2017}.
% Therefore, the VSFs increase towards larger separations.
% At $t$~=~1.5~Myr the shock front of the $t$~=~0.8~Myr SN hits the cloud.
% That causes a short period of extreme gravitational collapse, traced by the dip in $\zeta$.
% As in the other clouds, the gas relaxes rapidly after the shock.
% However, the interaction with the shock the cloud has introduced instability into the cloud, which continues to gravitationally contract.
% That is seen as a slow decrease of $\zeta$ from $t$~=~1.8~Myr on. 

% In summary, one can say that the scaling exponent, $\zeta$, that is obtained by fitting a power-law relation onto the measured VSF, is a useful tool to understand and evaluate the time evolution of turbulence within molecular clouds. 
% It is not only sensitive to both external (SNe) and internal (gravitational collapse) driving sources, but also reacts differently to the individual driving sources. 

% However, this diagnostic requires a 
% %mm series of time steps to be significant.
%      time history to be evaluated.
% %mm [I cannot find this in either paper. Can you point to where it is derived?] According to \citet{She1994} and \citet{Boldyrev2002}, $\zeta$(3) is supposed to be equal or larger than unity whenever the gas experiences supersonic turbulence. Although this is definitely the case in the simulated clouds \citepalias{IbanezMejia2016,IbanezMejia2017}, one sees that $\zeta$(3) declines far below 1 due to gravitational collapse. Thus, measuring $\zeta$ for individual moments in time, as observations would do, cannot fully describe the turbulence of molecular clouds.
% %
% The principle of extended self-similarity \citep[Sect.~\ref{methods:vsf}]{Benzi1993} offers a solution to this problem.
% %mm [not sure what this sentence is getting at.  It's not just intercloud turbulence, but a general statement of how turbulence behaves...] The principle reflects the nature and the properties of intercloud turbulence, even when it is dominated by gravitational collapse.
% However, we also detect strong deviations that either reduce or increase the measured values of $Z$ (see Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all}a).
% Those derivations can be related to the physical forces that currently dominate the clouds.

% The peaks in the $Z$ (for example, in \texttt{M4} at $t$~=~4.1~Myr) occur when $\zeta(3)$ 
% %mm reaches values close or below 0.
%        passes through zero.
% This means that the VSF becomes flat ($\zeta$~=~0) or increases 
% %mm forward
%     toward 
% smaller scales ($\zeta~<~0$). 
% In this case, self-gravitational contraction clearly dominates the cloud's evolution as it transfers turbulent power from the large to the small scales, where filaments and fragments are forming and accreting gas.

% The decrease in $Z$ (for example, in \texttt{M3} around $t$~=~1.8~Myr), on the other hand, occur when SN shocks hit and heavily impact the clouds. 
% This causes a sudden, but heavy increase of turbulent power on all scales, though on the larger scales more than on the smaller, resulting in a steepening of the VSF towards larger scales and an increase in $\zeta$.
% The VSFs become more sensitive to the shock the higher their order is.
% Therefore, the $\zeta(3)$ increases more rapidly than $\zeta(2)$ and $\zeta(1)$, causing $Z(2)$ and $Z(1)$ to decrease.

% In summary, $Z$ \textbf{is only a weak tracer for gravitational contraction, but a good tracer for shocks interacting with the cloud.}
% Whenever neither of these two extreme scenarios is acting on the clouds, the values of $Z$ are close to the predicted values (see discussion below).
% This means that \textbf{$Z$ and $\zeta$ are good tracers for processes suddenly driving turbulence within the cloud.
% However, when Z values are close to the ones predicted by theory, we cannot differentiate between freely decaying turbulence and moderate gravitational contraction}, as one can do it with $\zeta$.
% However, the advantage is that a single-epoch observation of $Z$ is sufficient to trace extreme motions and driving sources within observed molecular clouds.

% Whenever the turbulence within the clouds is not driven in an extreme way one sees that the ratio of the VSF scaling exponents is mostly in agreement with predicted values for self-similar turbulence, although the clouds are dominated by gravitationally contracting motions during their evolution.
% \textbf{The measured values of $Z$} do not uniquely follow the predictions of 
% %mm only \citet{Boldyrev2002} or \citet{She1994}, but are normally between the predicted values.
% %Recalling that both studies describe supersonic, fully developed turbulent flows, the only difference between them is the geometry along which they allow the gas to flow.
% %In the case of \citet{Boldyrev2002}, the gas flows are sheet-like, while they are filamentary in the work by \citet{She1994}.
%     \citet{She1994} or \citet{Boldyrev2002}, but often fall between the predicted values.  Since the former describes incompressible turbulence with purely filamentary dissipation regions, while the latter describes extremely compressible Burgers turbulence with dissipation only in sheets, the conclusion is that the actual flows lie in the intermediate regime of supersonic flow with moderate compressiblity.
% %mm 


% Since \texttt{M3} is heavily impacted by many SN shocks and strong collapsing motions, it does not allow us to make strong predictions about its 'steady-state' evolution.
% The other two clouds, on the contrary, are less externally impacted.
% This allows us to relate the developments of measured $Z$ to the internal evolution of the clouds.
% In \texttt{M8}, $Z$ follows the predictions by \citet{She1994} for most of the time.
% This \textbf{would suggest} that \texttt{M8} mostly transfers gas along filamentary substructures which means that the cloud is highly hierarchically structured already at the beginning of the simulations and before self-gravity is active.
% This also implies that the formation of filamentary structures does not require gravity \citep[e.g.,][]{Federrath2016}.
% The fact that we do not detect fragments before the clouds have evolved under the influence of self-gravity for at least one megayear \citepalias[see][]{Chira2018}, however, demonstrates that gravity is essential for the fragmentation of filaments and formation of further substructures.

% The evolution of $Z$ in \texttt{M4} shows a slightly different picture.
% While the values of $Z$ in \texttt{M8} are mostly constant over time, they decrease in \texttt{M4}, starting at values that are in agreement with the sheet-like flows of \citet{Boldyrev2002} to those that are predicted for filamentary flows by \citet{She1994}. 
% This demonstrates that \texttt{M4} develops its hierarchical structure as it evolves under the influence of self-gravity. 
% As a consequence, its turbulent structure becomes more dominated by the filaments with time which causes the decline of $Z$.
% Considering that the gas of \texttt{M4} is indeed first flattened into more sheet-like geometry through the impact of the SNe \citepalias{IbanezMejia2017} this observation is very interesting.
% It agrees with the studies, for example by \citet{Lin1965} or \citet{McKee2007}, that claim that molecular clouds are supposed to collapse in a dimension-losing, outside-in fashion that does not require any initial substructures within the clouds.

% In summary, $Z$ reflects the global geometry of turbulence within molecular clouds. 
% Thereby, the measured values of $Z$ are in good agreement with predictions from self-similarity theory, as long as one carefully ensures that the dominating turbulence mode in the cloud matches the modes that are considered in the respective theory.
% This makes $Z$ a reliable parameter for examining turbulence modes in observational studies.
% Furthermore, the time evolution of $Z$ shows how the geometry of turbulence is changed due to the gravitational contraction, e.g.~from sheet-like to filamentary vortices, accompanies the change of basic parameters describing the turbulent structure of the entire cloud. 
% $Z$ can also deviate from the predicted values. 
% This, however, only occurs in time spans of extreme turbulence driving, such as SN shocks.
% Thereby, these extreme driving sources affect $Z$ differently:
% SN shocks decrease $Z$, while gravity causes a \textbf{short-lived} peak in $Z$.
% In both cases, $Z$ relaxes to the pre-perturbation values within a short time.

\subsection{Line-of-Sight Velocities}\label{discussion:1d}

%mm In this paper, we do not only aim to analyse the mechanisms that drive turbulence within simulated molecular clouds, but also to provide a practical tool that can be used to understand the dynamical processes within the ISM better.
% For the latter, it is necessary to examine its applicability under and the dependencies of the obtained results on all relevant conditions. 
%As we have chosen to use VSFs for our analysis it is evident that we first need to investigate how the function reacts to the number of measured velocity vector components. 

%We recall that the VSF relates to the average relative velocity between the clouds' gas cells (see 
           Our discussion so far has focused on 3D measurements of VSFs
(Eq.~[\ref{equ:method:def_vsf}]).
%This means that for a proper analysis one needs all three components of the three-dimensional (3D) velocity vector for each contributing cell.
%mm Observations, however, normally measure only the one (1D) component along the line-of-sight.
%mm , also known as local standard of rest velocity. [not really... LSR is the los velocity relative to the local stars, which may or may not be relevant...] 
%If the gas moves exclusively along the los, both the 3D and 1D velocity measurements will return the same VSF. 
%If the gas is, contrary, moving along directions perpendicular to the los the 1D VSF will be absolutely 0.
% 
%In this section, we discuss the results considering this aspect.
%mm Hence, we use the same data of the model clouds as before and produce three subsamples by projecting the 3D velocity vectors onto the three major axes x, y, and~z, respectively.
%The derived $\zeta$ and $Z$ for each subsample are shown in Figs.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}b and~\ref{pic:results:z_all}b.
%
In Sect.~\ref{results:1d} we have seen that the $\zeta$ and $Z$ derived from the 1D VSFs generally evolve similarly as those derived from the 3D VSFs.
Yet, we have also seen that individual sight lines may evolve differently.
%mm Those differences are generated when the gas is significantly more driven into the corresponding los than into the others (analogously to the simple scenario described above). 
    These differences appear to reflect the detailed geometry of shock impacts on the cloud, 
     which are reflected more strongly in the higher-order VSFs.
%
For example, for the first 2~Myr of the evolution of \texttt{M4} the values of $Z$ along the $y$-axis are significantly higher than those observed along the other axes 
%mm and the predicted values.
    and diverge significantly from the values expected for uniform turbulence.
Recall that a perturbation in $Z$ usually corresponds to an episode of strong 
%mm [this was not at all the conclusion in Section 3] gravitational contraction, we can conclude that within this time span \texttt{M4} is dominantly collapsing along its y axis.
     shock driving, suggesting an impact along the $y$-axis at this time. 
%The values of $Z$ that are measured for the other two axes agree with this conclusion as they are best predicted by \citet{Boldyrev2002} who describes a sheet-like turbulence.  
     Along the other two axes, $Z$ continues to agree with supersonic turbulence 
     \citep{Boldyrev2002}.
Note that this effect is only visible as we analyse the three dimensions separately, while the driving of the gas along the $y$-axis is averaged out in the 3D VSFs (see Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all}a).

In summary, 
%mm we see that 
for a fully developed 3D turbulent field we expect that 1D VSFs behave similarly to 3D VSFs.
However, when there is a preferred direction along which the gas flows, the 1D and 3D VSFs differ significantly from each other. 
Thus, we predict that observed VSFs reflect the nature of turbulence within molecular clouds unless there is clear evidence that the gas is driven in a particular direction (e.g., by 
%mm an proto-/stellar feedback,
     a stellar wind 
or SN shock front).

Note that this analysis does not take typical line-of-sight effects, such as optical depth or blending, into account. 
%mm As we have seen in Sect.~\ref{results:densthres}, a good knowledge of the origin of velocity information is essential for a proper interpretation of the obtained VSFs.
Future studies need to investigate this point in more detail by performing 
%mm elaborated 
    VSF analyses based on 
full radiative transfer calculations. 

\subsection{Density Thresholds}\label{discussion:densthres}

%mm [repeats sections 2 and 3] \textbf{In Sect.~\ref{results:densthres} we have tested the influence of the density threshold that defines the volume of interest on the behaviour of the VSF.
% In the work presented in this paper, we normally define the clouds as volumes of connected gas cells with number densities above n$_\mathrm{cloud}$~=~100~cm$^{-3}$.
% Although this approach is in agreement with typical post-processing methods of observational data, it also means that we analyse only $\leq$1.5\% of the cubes' volumes, ignoring the more diffuse parts at the outer rims of the molecular clouds and the ISM.
% This raises the question: Are the turbulent motions within the entire ISM and the denser molecular clouds driven by the same processes?
% For targeting this question we have repleated our analysis and set n$_\mathrm{cloud}$~=~0~cm$^{-3}$.
% Figs.~\ref{pic:results:zeta_all}c and~\ref{pic:results:z_all}c illustrate the results.
% }

We find that the structure and behaviour of VSFs strongly depends on whether or not 
%mm there is a density threshold. 
    we assume a density threshold in computing them.
In the 
%mm previous 
     fiducial 
case, where n$_\mathrm{cloud}$~=~100~cm$^{-3}$, we have seen a mostly straight decline of $\zeta$ while $Z$ remains fairly constant over time, reflecting the contraction of the clouds due to self-gravity.
%
%mm Here, in the n$_\mathrm{cloud}$~=~0~cm$^{-3}$ sample, 
   On the other hand, if we remove the density threshold, including the entire high-resolution 
   region in the calculation,
we observe a completely different picture.
%mm
    The high velocities present in the diffuse interstellar medium surrounding the cloud 
     lead to strong large-scale power and thus much steeper VSFs, corresponding to 
     higher values of $\zeta$. 
There is still a slightly declining trend in $\zeta$, but the evolution is dominated by random fluctuations.
We also see that 
%mm the measured $Z$  evolves completely constantly.
     $Z$ remains constant for the entire simulation in every case.
%mm
%mm This is true for the entire time range and the exactly same values of $Z$ measured for all clouds.
%This can only be the case when the here analysed VSFs reflect the turbulent structure of the entire ISM in which all three clouds are embedded in.
%Furthermore, the source that drives the turbulence within the ISM acts constantly and isotropically on the diffuse gas.
%Thus, the ISM matter around the clouds can not be driven by individual events, like single SNe, as they do not have a high enough impact on the entire ISM, particularly not compared to the impact they have on individual molecular clouds that are comparably quiet zones within the ISM.
    The VSFs for the entire box appear consistent with the prediction for the value in incompressible turbulence \citep{Boldyrev2002}. This suggests that they are dominated by the subsonic flow in the hot gas with $T > 10^6$~K that occupies most of the volume of the box.  


We conclude that the decision of whether or not a density threshold is used 
%mm for ascertaining insights on the turbulent composition of the observed gas 
has a significant and direct influence on the resulting VSFs.
%mm
     Indeed, 
%mm However, as mentioned previously, applying a density threshold is often unavoidable as
it is a straight-forward approach to
%mm filter the data 
    focus the analysis 
on the actual area of interest.
In observational studies such a threshold will anyway always be present as minimal collision rates for excitation or the sensitivity of detectors automatically introduce implicit density or intensity thresholds. 
Although we have only tested two specific setups in this context we have seen the significance of a proper choice of the density threshold, as well as a proper discussion of the obtained results considering the threshold as one of the defining parameters.

\subsection{Density Weighting}\label{discussion:densweight}


In this subsection, we discuss the effect 
%mm the ambiguous definition of VSFs has on the measurements. With this we mean that the VSF can be computed with or without taking density weighting into account.
     of computing the VSF with or without including density weighting, relying on the 
     results presented in Sect.~\ref{results:densweight}.
%mm This ambiguity originates in the type of data one analyses.
% In general, the VSF considers the average relative velocity between two individual Lagrangian particles or turbulent vortices.
% As each particle stores its complete set of information, its mass, and therefore its inertia, is automatically considered when iterating its velocity.
% This makes Eq.~(\ref{equ:method:def_vsf}) sufficient for deriving the VSF of the fluid properly.

% In our case, however, we examine Eulerian data that store the parameters of the fluid on a static grid. 
% The information of individual particles and vortices are, thereby, averaged over the grid.
% Consequently, it is important to consider this when computing the VSF.
% This is done by using the density-weighted definition of the VSF given in Eq.~(\ref{equ:method:def_vsf}).

% Although the motivation why there are different definitions of the VSF and why they are used for non-overlapping samples of data, it is not yet clear how the results obtained with the two approaches relate to each other. 
% We investigate that question by applying both approaches on our data.
% The results are presented in Sect.~\ref{results:densweight}. We see that as
   As 
long as the turbulence is dominated by the large scales,
%mm
    and a density threshold is used, 
considering the density weighting does not have a significant effect.
%mm on the data. 
However, as the clouds evolve the differences increase:
%mm because 
the non-weighted VSFs never drop below 0.5.
This is because the non-weighted VSF treats all cells equally, no matter whether the particular cell represents a dense element of the cloud centre or a diffuse element of the cloud's edge, while the weighted VSF gives more weight to the matter within the
%mm clouds.
      small-scale, dense, collapsing regions.  The kinetic energy is dominated by
      these regions.  Thus,
%mm As long as the turbulence is dominated by large scales this does not cause a notable difference as these long separations represent cells on the outer surface of the clouds, with similar densities and conditions. The small lag scales, on the contrary, reflect how the conditions change within the clouds, with density gradients becoming larger towards the centre of the clouds and increasing faster than the relative velocities of neighbouring cells. 
%In this case, the density weighting becomes crucial to compensate for the fact that the higher density represents a higher number of particles in a Lagrangian framework.
%However, if one does not consider this (as we do when using the non-weighted definition of the VSF) the inner regions of the clouds are not processed correctly.
%This ends in a situation where the large scales never seem to lose their dominance in term of kinetic energy, and $\zeta$ never becomes close or less than 0; a situation that does not reflect the reality.
     neglecting density weighting decouples the VSF from the kinetic energy distribution. 
     This is particularly important at late times when small-scale collapse dominates.

%mm In summary, we can trace the discrepancies between the scaling exponents of density-weighted and non-weighted VSFs back to the \textbf{inability} of the non-weighted VSFs to follow the transition form large-scale driven to small-scale dominated distributions of turbulent power.


Nevertheless, Fig.~\ref{pic:results:z_all}(d) illustrates that these differences 
%mm can be traced by $\zeta$ only. 
    do not prevent extended self-similarity from holding. Regardless of whether
    density-weighting is included, the values of $Z$ remain similar, with similar
    responses to external driving, except for 
%mmvalues, evolve and reacts to external driving mechanisms similarly independently based on which approach they are computed. Besides 
the features created when $\zeta(3)$ 
%mm becomes close to 0 
   passes through zero
in the density-weighted VSFs.
%mm , the measured $Z$ have similar values, evolve and reacts to external driving mechanisms similarly independently based on which approach they are computed. 
This observation is true for all Jeans refinement levels, as Fig.~\ref{pic:results:comp_weighting} demonstrates.

We conclude that deriving the VSF from smooth density distributions without considering density-weighting does not affect the behaviour of $\zeta$ and $Z$, as long as the turbulence is dominated by large scale 
%mm vortices, while
    flows, but 
it has a significant effect on the measurements when the small scales become dominant.
The latter is particularly important as this finding has a directly impact on the conclusions drawn based on the scales and mechanisms that drive the turbulence based on the measured $\zeta$.
Not only does $\zeta$ become insensitive to the influence of gravitational contraction with time, the non-weighted VSFs also do not reflect when the majority of kinetic energy has been transferred to small scales. 
%mm Thus, it is highly important to clarify which definition of VSF is used and if it is indeed suitable for the respective study. Yet, our analysis also shows that the principle of self-similarity relativises the deviations between the two approaches as the different orders of the VSFs keep scaling in the same way relative to each other. 

\subsection{Jeans Length Refinement}\label{discussion:refinement}

%mm In Sect.~\ref{results:refinement}, we have motivated the need to investigate the influence of Jeans refinement on VSFs.
% In particular, we examine how the choice of using the minimal required refinement compares to a generally recommended refinement level, including the differences in total energy and resonances seen in the power spectra. 
% To do this, we use the data by \citetalias{IbanezMejia2017} that resolve the Jeans length in \texttt{M3} twice ($\lambda_J$~=~$8\Delta{}x$) and eight times ($\lambda_J$~=~$32\Delta{}x$) finer as the original simulations ($\lambda_J$~=~$4\Delta{}x$).

In Fig.~\ref{pic:results:jeans_comp} we see that the choice of refinement level does not have to have a significant influence on the measurements and evolution of both $\zeta$ and $Z$. 
$\lambda_J$~=~$4\Delta{}x$ and $\lambda_J$~=~$8\Delta{}x$ are in 
%mm very 
good agreement with each other.
This means that, although refining Jeans lengths with 4~cells misses about 13\% of kinetic energy, the effect on the structure and behaviour of the turbulence is rather small and not traced by the VSF analysis.

However, Fig.~\ref{pic:results:jeans_comp} shows that the agreement is 
%mm not given 
   rather poorer
with $\lambda_J$~=~$32\Delta{}x$, as the latter differs more from $\lambda_J$~=~$4\Delta{}x$ the higher the order of the VSF is.
Following the explanations in Sect.~\ref{results:refinement}, the behaviour of $\zeta$ and $Z$ in the $\lambda_J$~=~$32\Delta{}x$ runs corresponds to the reaction of the cloud's gas to a shock wave running through the cloud; caused by a supernova that exploded before $t$~=~0~Myr. 
Indeed one sees a SN at a distance of 172~pc at $t$~=~-1.11~Myr. 
Due to the distance the SN is too weak to effectively compress the gas within \texttt{M3} and cause a shock.
This is why it was not detected in the less refined samples.
However, the SN explodes far below the mid-plane of the simulated disk galaxy, in a region without dense gas, so
%mm This means that the shock wave, that has been injected by the explosion, is less damped 
    the blast wave remains strong
as it propagates through the ISM. 
By the time the blast arrives at cloud \texttt{M3}, it is still energetic enough to drive strong winds, with velocities above 300~km~s$^{-1}$, at the closer edge of the cloud. 
This causes an increase of VSFs at longer lag scales and the increase of $\zeta$, as well as the drop in $Z$.
%mm
%mm Derivations of measured $Z$ to predicted values do trace external turbulent driving.
%Whether the source is a SN shock front propagating through the cloud or a strong wind, cannot be distinguished by $Z$ only. 
%Yet, $Z$ remains a fine probe for the geometry of turbulence and the scales at which turbulence is driven.
   We conclude that improving the resolution resolves details that can affect the VSF, 
   but that the overall behavior is already determined by our moderate resolution simulations.
