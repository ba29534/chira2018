	{ %context    	
                Supersonic disordered flows accompany the formation and evolution of molecular clouds (MCs). It has been argued that this is turbulence that can support against gravitational collapse and promote the formation of hierarchical sub-structures. However, little is known about what drives gas dynamics on MC scales.
    	}
	{ %aims
    	We investigate the time evolution of gas dynamics within simulated MCs. We focus on the following questions: What physical process dominates the driving of the disordered flows seen?  How can these flows be characterized? Are they consistent with turbulence? Do the simulated flows agree with the observations?
    	} 
	{ %methods 
	We follow the gas motions within three MCs that have formed self-consistently within kiloparsec-scale numerical simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM). The simulated ISM evolves under the influence of physical processes including self-gravity, magnetic fields, supernovae-driven turbulence, and radiative heating and cooling. We characterize the flow using velocity structure functions (VSFs) and compare the obtained parameters with predicted and observed values.
    	}
	{ %results
    	We demonstrate that the scaling exponent of VSFs and the self-similarity parameter are sensitive tools that trace the dominant driving sources of the flow. The trends are generally robust against the influence of projection, Jeans refinement level, and density-weighting. Yet, the detailed evolution may vary significantly depending on the density threshold. 
    	}
	{ %conclusions
        We conclude that the VSF is a well placed and stable method for examining the composition, structure and evolution of turbulence within MCs. Yet, it is essential to clearly define the underlying conditions and assumptions of the analysis, as well as the phase of the ISM that is studied to make the results comparable. We find clear indicators of how the VSF reacts to the dynamics in the simulated clouds: Gravitational contraction dominates the turbulent flows in the simulations. It causes a flattening of the VSF that has no imprint on its self-similarity. The injection of energy by shocks, on the other hand, is visible in the VSFs and the self-similarity parameters, but the injected energy decays within a short period of time. Our results agree well with observed VSFs of molecular clouds with embedded star formation activities.
