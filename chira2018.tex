\abstract
	{ %context
    	For a long time it has been argued that turbulence is an important requirement for the formation and evolution of molecular clouds (MCs). It is supposed to be the dominant process that stabilises MCs against gravitational collapse and supports the formation of hierarchical sub-structures. Yet, little is still known about the sources of turbulence that dominates the gas dynamics on scales of entire MCs.
    	}
	{ %aims
    	We investigate the time evolution of turbulence within simulated MCs. We focus on the following questions: What dominantly drives turbulence within MCs? And is there a method that traces these dominant modes based in both simulated and observational data?
    	} 
	{ %methods 
	We follow the gas motions within three MCs that have formed self-consistently within kiloparsec-scale numerical simulations of the interstellar medium (ISM). The simulated ISM evolves under the influence of different physical processes, i.e.~self-gravity, magnetic fields, supernovae-driven turbulence, and radiative heating and cooling. We express the distribution of turbulent power in terms of velocity structure functions (VSFs) and compare the obtained parameters with predicted values.
    	}
	{ %results
    	We demonstrate that the scaling exponent of VSFs and the self-similarity parameter are sensitive tools that trace the dominant driving sources of turbulence. The trends are generally robust against the influence of projection, Jeans refinement level, and density-weighting. Yet, the detailed evolution may vary significantly depending on the density threshold.
    	}
	{ %conclusions
        We conclude that the VSF is a well placed and stable method for examining the composition, structure and evolution of turbulence within the MCs. Yet, it is essential to clearly define the underlying conditions and assumptions of the analysis in order to clarify which part of the ISM is studied and to make the results comparable to analogue studies. In our case, we find clear indicators of how the VSF reacts to the dynamics in the simulated clouds: The turbulence in the clouds is dominantly driven by contraction, as a reaction to the on-set of self-gravity within the simulations. Occasionally, SN shocks inject new kinetic energy on large scales into the systems. The effect lasts only for a short period of time before gravity dominates the energy cascade again.
