\section{Additional Figures}\label{appFigures}

\textbf{
    In this section, we aim to verify that there is a reasonable range of scales, in terms of $\ell$, where the simulations are not dominated by numerical diffusion, but rather by correctly simulated turbulent cascades.
    Therefore, we offer more examples that show additional VSFs of all three clouds at different times and considering different analysis approaches.
    In particular, we focus on the standard analysis (Sects.~\ref{results:normal} and~\ref{discussion:normal}, Figs.~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_with_threshold_s_vs_l} and~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_with_threshold_sl_vs_l}), the density threshold-less scenario (Sects.~\ref{results:densthres} and~\ref{discussion:densthres}, Figs.~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_without_threshold_s_vs_l} and~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_without_threshold_sl_vs_l}), and the impact analysis of different Jeans refinement levels (Sects.~\ref{results:refinement} and~\ref{discussion:refinement}, Figs.~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_jeans_s_vs_l} and~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_jeans_sl_vs_l}).

\textbf{
    The figures are similar to the examples shown in Fig.~\ref{pic:results:vsf_example}, but with data from all three clouds and at three different snapshots during the simulations.
    The straight lines within the plots indicate the power-law relation that we have fitted onto the VSFs, considering the range $\ell\,\leq$~8~pc.

\textbf{
    We see that in most of the cases the VSFs are in good agreement with the described power-law relation within the fitted ranges (e.g., Fig.~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_with_threshold_s_vs_l}). 
    Yet, there are cases when the VSF is not well reproduced by a simple, single power-law.
    Examples are: \texttt{M3} at $t$~=~3.0~Myr in Fig.~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_with_threshold_s_vs_l} or \texttt{M3} at $t$~=~0.8~Myr and with $\lambda_\mathrm{J}$~=~32$\Delta$x in Fig.~\ref{pic:appFigures:examples_jeans_s_vs_l}.
    In the firs case, we dominating source of turbulence within the cloud is switching of large-scale driving to contraction-driven. 
    This means that the outer regions of the clouds (larger $\ell$) are still dominated by external driving, while the inner regions (smaller $\ell$) start accelerate mostly due to fragmentation and infall motions.
    The consequence is that the actual VSF is a super-position of two processes that amply the relative motions of the gas portions differently and on different scales, which a single power-law is incapable to reproduce adequately. 
    However, this scenario occurs only in a small sample of time steps in all simulations.

\textbf{
    The second example represents a VSF of a cloud through which a SN blast wave is currently propagating.
    In this case the maximal amplification is neither on the far end of the cloud, where the turbulence is driven by external sources, nor on small scales where gravitational contraction acts.
    Instead the (local) maximum is the intermediate scale. 
    Considering the morphology of the cloud and the cloud's environment this can only
